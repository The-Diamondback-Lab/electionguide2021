<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Mayor Patrick Wojahn is running for his fourth term as mayor of College Park. The race for the position is uncontested.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">The current mayor said he has “unfinished business” from the last few years as mayor, including his goal of enhancing downtown and commercial areas and building a stronger relationship with the University of Maryland.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">“We have so many great resources because of the university, we have so many different things at our fingertips. We have arts and culture and great restaurants and exciting commercial areas and great neighborhoods,” Wojahn said. “It's an incredibly diverse community.”</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">The city should prioritize rebuilding local businesses as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic fallout, which will allow the city’s downtown area to be more “vibrant and exciting,” Wojahn said.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Another one of Wojahn’s objectives as mayor is to oversee a “long overdue'' restorative justice project in the Lakeland community of College Park, a historically Black neighborhood devastated by a city urban renewal plan passed in 1970.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Wojahn has lived in College Park for over 18 years with his husband. The longtime cyclist also works as director of government relations at Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, advocating for safe bicycle and pedestrian paths, according to the city’s website.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Prior to his time as mayor, Wojahn was a policy and legal representative for the rights of people living with HIV and AIDS, as well as people with disabilities in the Washington, D.C., area, according to the city’s website.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">“I bring a perspective of having often represented the underdog,” Wojahn said. “And that is something that shaped my work as mayor and city council member.”</span></p>
