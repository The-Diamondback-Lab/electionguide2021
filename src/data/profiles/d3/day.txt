<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Robert Day is running for his sixth term as a College Park council member - and he's running in one of two contested races this year.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Day joined the city council in 2011, and he's running for reelection because there are things he still wants to see completed in the city, he said.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Specifically, he wants to improve the quality of life in College Park by building the education system <span>&#8212;</span> such as by developing College Park Academy <span>&#8212;</span> and providing more affordable housing for seniors, students and families. He plans to work with neighboring municipalities to solve issues.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"I am committed to fighting for the city of College Park," he said.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">College Park is in a "very precarious time," Day said, due to issues such as redistricting.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"This isn't a time for us to be playing around and not have the right leadership in place, the right connections, the right people in the positions that are needed to help our city grow within the county," he said.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">He added that as a result, the city council needs to be strong.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"We need to be able to work with people, and that takes a long time to develop," Day said. "We don't have that time right now ... we need to maintain our leadership that we have and continue to grow."</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Having served in the position for a decade, Day said he has already established connections and networking for the position.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">In addition to already being familiar with the city council, Day is able to work with people from the university, county, state and region, he said.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"I get to work and talk with many other government agencies and ... leaders from other government entities within the region," he said.</span></p>
