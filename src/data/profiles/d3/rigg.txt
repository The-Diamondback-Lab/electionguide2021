<p class="c13"><span class="c1">John Rigg is running for his third term as a District 3 council member in one of two contested races in this year’s elections.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">If he is elected to another term, Rigg wants to focus on advancing racial justice — an issue he took a lead on last year.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Rigg wrote an amendment to an ordinance that the council passed in summer 2020 formally acknowledging that residents of Lakeland — a historically Black neighborhood in College Park — were displaced during development in the 1970s.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"It's important to acknowledge the wrongs that the city has done," Rigg said. "[I'm] looking forward to the next term, coming up with concrete ways to help restore that community, to help give some sense of resolution."</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">He also wants to discuss housing in the city. More developers are eager to propose developments in the city these days, Rigg said, and the council should take advantage of that.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"I think it's a great time to start talking about ways in which we can produce, for example, affordable housing for students and non-student residents alike in the city," he said.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Rigg has spent time in Boulder, Colorado, and Ann Arbor, Michigan — where his mother and wife are from, respectively — and thinks College Park should follow those college towns' models of welcoming small businesses. Those types of businesses would cater to the city's diverse population, he said.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"We have a lot of chain restaurants, and those chain restaurants provide a level of stability,” Rigg said. “But they don't provide the level of variety and the true uniqueness that you see in some college towns."</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">​​Before joining the city council in 2017, Rigg was the president of the Calvert Hills Citizens Association for five years. He has lived in the Calvert Hills neighborhood since 2007. Rigg also works for the United States Department of Health and Human Services.</span></p>
