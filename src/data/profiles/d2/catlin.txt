<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Catlin served on the city council from 1997 to 2013, according to the city’s website. He hopes to return to the council to work on housing and development issues, which he said are “front and center” in College Park.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">“Twenty years ago, I think I had quite an impact on how things were done,” Catlin said. “And I've got some ideas about things we can do this time.”</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">With more development in College Park comes more tax revenue, which Catlin said he aims to use to provide housing solutions for students, ​​people with disabilities, older adults and low-income families.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">“I'm trained as an economist, so I've always been considered like the numbers person on the council when I was on it,” Catlin said.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Another of his strengths, Catlin said, is his history in the city and connections with College Park’s “big players.”</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Since his time on the council, Catlin has stayed active in the community as a leader in a few of College Park’s local organizations.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Catlin moved to College Park in 1989, and said he loves the area’s diverse neighborhoods and the city’s “out of the ordinary” commercial district.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">“I've just found it to be a neat place,” Catlin said.</span></p>
