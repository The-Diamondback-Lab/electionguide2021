<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">This goal, Esters said, includes projects such as restorative justice in the historically Black Lakeland community and finding affordable housing solutions.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">She is also interested in neighborhood preservation, encouraging homeownership and maintenance of local communities, especially in the Lakeland and Berwyn neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Esters also hopes to work on more projects such as the city council's gained jurisdiction of Rhode Island Avenue, a major road in the city, from Prince George's County.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Esters has lived in College Park since 1999, and one of her favorite things about the area is its proximity to the University of Maryland.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">For more than 25 years, she's worked as a higher education administrator, according to the city's website, which Esters said has given her plenty of experience engaging with parents, students and faculty.</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"It's important to listen and, in my work, it has been invaluable," Esters said. "When you're in such a position it's important to do that, to be thoughtful, to think about things long term, not only what may happen in a given moment, but how [a decision will] affect the city and its residents long-term."</span></p>
