<p class="c9"><span class="c1">Susan Whitney is running for a council member position in College Park’s District 2. After moving to the city 16 years ago, Whitney says she wants to be a part of College Park’s progress.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span>“I want to contribute to the community that I live in, and I love living in College Park,” Whitney said. </span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c9"><span>Whitney aims to protect the affordability and interests of current College Park neighborhoods despite new developments, according to the city’s website. Whitney said she intends to advocate for restorative justice in Lakeland, a historically Black neighborhood mostly destroyed by the city’s urban renewal plan in the 1970s.</span></p>
<p class="c25 c14 c22"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c22 c25"><span>She hopes to help continue College Park’s development and is excited to see new restaurants and businesses open in the area.</span></p>
<p class="c25 c14 c22"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c22 c25"><span>“I adore the little Berwyn commercial district,” Whitney said. “I'm eager to see that get more businesses and I hope to be part of moving that along.”</span></p>
<p class="c25 c14 c22"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c22 c25"><span>She currently works as a business and HR manager for a software company in Silver Spring, negotiating contracts, managing books and handling payroll and any disputes with staff.</span></p>
<p class="c25 c14 c22"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c22 c25"><span>“All of that, I think, has given me kind of the ability to pay attention to the nitty gritty of contracts and of ... codes that need to be rewritten or just anything that has to do with very precise language and contracts, I am exceptionally good at,” Whitney said.</span></p>
<p class="c25 c14 c22"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c22 c25"><span>In the past, Whitney has served as treasurer for her daughter’s PTSA, bringing it into compliance for the first time in the organization’s 14-year history. She was also treasurer of current District 2 council member Llatetra Brown Esters’ campaign during the district’s special election in November 2020.</span></p>
<p class="c22 c25"><span>An avid runner, Whitney says she regularly explores the city’s trails on runs with her dog. She is also proud of the area’s public schools, which her daughter attends. She also co-founded the DC Lady Arm Wrestlers, which raised $55,000 for charities benefiting women and children.</span></p>
