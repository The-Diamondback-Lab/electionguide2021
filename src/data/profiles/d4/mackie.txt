<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Raised in College Park, Mackie previously worked at NASA Goddard and served as the District 4 Board of Elections supervisor before running for council, according to the city website.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Mackie's goals are to address the city's ongoing stormwater management problems and  continue working on College Park's strategic plan, which outlines long-term goals for the city, she said. She hopes to focus on neighborhood stabilization and keeping long-term residents in College Park, which she thinks is the most pressing issue the city is facing.</span></p>

<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"Part of the strategic plan is to really solidify our neighborhoods and make them sustainable and workable," Mackie said.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Mackie also wants to make sure landlords in College Park are treating renters fairly and businesses affected by the pandemic can receive the help they need.</span></p>

<p class="c13"><span class="c1">Mackie was notably one of three council members to vote against giving a revitalization tax credit to developer Gilbane for the Tempo student housing project. She is an advocate for preserving green spaces and trails and making College Park a place where residents can have a "good quality of life."</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"I love College Park," Mackie said. "I've lived here for almost 50 years, and I want other people to feel the same way."</span></p> 
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">During her first term on council, Mackie feels she was able to learn from other council members. She's looking forward to applying some of that newfound knowledge in her second term.</span></p>
<p class="c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c1">"I've worked really hard in being an advocate for the people, whether they be an older person [or] a college student," Mackie said. "I feel like I've made some headway in helping people navigate the system."</span></p>
